## 🔐 Firebase Setup

- User tokens are passed to backend for secured routes.

## 🔧 API Endpoints (Frontend Integration)

All backend endpoints are called using Axios, e.g.:

\`\`\`js
axios.post("https://food-server-sooty.vercel.app/add-food", foodData)
\`\`\`

Sample endpoints:
| Method | Route                              | Description                     |
|--------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | \`/all-foods\`                       | Get all available foods         |
| GET    | \`/food-featured\`                   | Get top 6 featured foods        |
| POST   | \`/add-food\`                        | Add food to the database        |
| POST   | \`/request-food\`                    | Request a food                  |
| GET    | \`/requested-foods\`                 | Get user's requested foods      |
